# Assignment1cs303
in this assignment I have 5 main functions:

int ReadTheDamnFile(int numList[], int counter);

int thisThangInHere(int Here[],int size, int target);

pair<int, int> modify(int index, int newval, int numList[]);

void AddThatToEndOfArray(int arrayToModify[], int that, int &counter);

void modifyArrayAtIndex(int arr[], int index, bool remove, int counter);

all of them are mostly self explanitory, ReadTheDamnFile returns the elements of the array that it added for an easy way to keep track of that. also the main just shows off some functionality nothing to really note there.
